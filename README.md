# Micro-gpt
 foundational groundwork for building a character-level language model
## Academic and Critical Overview of Initial Exploration

This educational material on microGPT lays the foundational groundwork for constructing a character-level language model, progressing from raw text data to a rudimentary probabilistic framework. This initial exploration is essential for comprehending the fundamental procedures involved in sequential data processing for machine learning applications, particularly within the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP).
**What we have explored:**

*   **Data Loading and Inspection:** We began by loading a raw text dataset (Shakespeare's works). This is the essential first step in any data-driven project, allowing us to understand the nature and scale of our input.
*   **Character-level Tokenization and Encoding:** We converted the raw text into a sequence of integers. This process, specifically character-level tokenization, treats each character as a distinct unit. This is a fundamental technique in NLP for converting unstructured text into a numerical format that machine learning models can process. The creation of `stoi` and `itos` mappings is a standard approach for managing the vocabulary.
*   **Dataset Splitting:** We divided the data into training and validation sets. This is a crucial practice in machine learning to prevent overfitting and provide an unbiased evaluation of the model's performance on unseen data. The 90/10 split is a common heuristic, though the optimal ratio can depend on the dataset size.
*   **Input and Target Preparation (Block Size and Batching):** We demonstrated how the sequential data is structured into input-target pairs based on a `block_size` (context window). This highlights the autoregressive nature of the language modeling task, where the model predicts the next token based on a fixed-length history. The `get_batch` function illustrates how data is efficiently prepared in batches for training neural networks, leveraging parallel processing.
*   **Basic Language Model (Bigram):** We implemented a simple Bigram Language Model. This model serves as a crucial baseline. While simplistic (only considering the previous token), it introduces the core concept of learning token probabilities and generating text based on these probabilities. It demonstrates the fundamental forward pass, loss calculation (Cross-Entropy, a standard loss function for classification tasks like predicting the next token), and text generation process.

**Why we do it :**

*   **From Raw Data to Model Input:** The process of loading, inspecting, tokenizing, and encoding is a necessary transformation to bridge the gap between human-readable text and the numerical input required by machine learning models. Understanding this pipeline is fundamental to working with text data.
*   **Establishing a Baseline:** The Bigram model, despite its limitations, is vital for establishing a baseline performance. Any more complex model, like the Transformer we will build, must outperform this baseline to demonstrate its value. Critically, the Bigram model highlights the limitations of short-range dependencies in language.
*   **Understanding the Language Modeling Task:** The preparation of input-target pairs explicitly defines the language modeling objective: predicting the next token given the preceding context. This is a core task in generative AI and underlies many NLP applications.
*   **Introduction to PyTorch Fundamentals:** The code introduces fundamental PyTorch concepts like tensors, modules (`nn.Module`), loss functions (`F.cross_entropy`), and optimizers (`torch.optim.AdamW`). These are essential building blocks for implementing more complex deep learning models.
*   **The Need for More Complex Models:** The poor quality of text generated by the untrained and simply trained Bigram model implicitly motivates the need for more sophisticated architectures that can capture longer-range dependencies and more complex linguistic patterns, leading into the subsequent sections on the Transformer architecture.

In essence, this initial phase is a microcosm of a typical machine learning workflow applied to sequential data, emphasizing data preparation, baseline modeling, and the fundamental principles of training a probabilistic model to understand and generate text. It critically exposes the challenges that more advanced models like the Transformer are designed to address.
